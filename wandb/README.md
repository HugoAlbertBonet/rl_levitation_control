# Development of the levitation control system of a hyperloop vehicle using Deep Reinforcement Learning

This repository includes the experiments and the progress related to the development of a levitation control system for the vehicle of [Hyperloop UPV](https://hyperloopupv.com/) by means of Deep Reinforcement Learning algorithms. 

The repository includes the step by step progress during the academic year 2023/24, including the first attempts with different RL algorithms, the creation of a 1 DOF controller and the evolution towards achieving 5 DOF levitation, and the optimization and transformation to ONNX in order to be used in an STM32 microcontroller.
